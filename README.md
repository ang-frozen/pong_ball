## PONG BALL
Simple pong ball using pygame.

## Library
``` import pygame ```
It runs with pygame_ce or community edition.

# How to run
Please install Pygame ce if you have not already done that. 
In PowerShell, 
```pip install pygame_ce ``` 
or in notebook
```!pip install pygame_ce```


Clone this repo, 


```git clone https://github.com/ang-frozen/pong_ball.git```

In the notebook run ```!git``` instead of ```git```. I recommend, using a Python editor instead of a notebook like VSCode or Pycharm, etc.


Run the .py file, Thats all.


### Improvement Options:

1. Fix bugs if you notice
2. You can add the number of matches, like 3, 5, 7 matches and whoever wins the maximum number of times wins the tournament.
3. Use a more complex opponent.
4. Real-time server for dual players.
5. Improve the UI.
